**Sign in like this:**

1) Open: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16lh2Ta_ZVLKOXfN-Z4_369_zkxPGWx2kUHipjnsBHbw/edit?usp=sharing
2) Add your full name and email address to the `ActiveParticipants` sheet.
3) Add your full name also to the `PastMatches` sheet and add people you already met/do not want to meet in a comma-separated way (no extra spaces) into the `PastMatches` column. In most cases you will just leave it empty.
4) You're all set! You will be matched with someone else in the next cycle.

**Once signed up the following is the process:**

1) Every once in a while (usually every month) you will be randomly matched with another participant.
2) I will send out an email that the new matches are available.
3) Check out the `Matches` sheet to see who you are matched with.
4) Get in touch with your match and arrange a coffee date with your match (no pressure, if you don't have time this cycle or don't want to meet - up to you). Everything is possible be it Zoom, in person, or going for a walk together - the general suggestion would be to keep it rather short (around 30 minutes) and casual.
5) If want to be rematched or have any questions, let me know :)
